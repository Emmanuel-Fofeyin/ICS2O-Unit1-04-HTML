    <h1> Coding and Computers. </h1>
    <p>Proper HTML style is important. Coding has over seven hundred different languages. (fun fact) the first computer virus was called a creeper.In our world today coading is becoming just as important as reading.The first electronic computer ENIAC weighed more than 27 tons and took up 1800 square feet. TYPEWRITER is the longest word that you can write using the letters only on one row of the keyboard of your computer. </p>
